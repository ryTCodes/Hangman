# Hangman Game

This project is a classic Hangman game implemented in Python. It includes ASCII art for visual representation, a list of challenging words, and interactive gameplay. The game randomly selects a word, and the player tries to guess it letter by letter. The player has a limited number of attempts (lives) to guess the word correctly before losing the game.
